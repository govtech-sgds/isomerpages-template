    This file swaps alternates the gray_container_class variable between "" and "bg-newssection"
    It was written as an include file so that it can be included after each section, since it is possible that users mis-enter the YAML (leaving out the dash) and end up entering 2 entries in the same array e.g.:

    - hero:
        title: Isomer Pages Template
        subtitle: This website was built using the Isomer Design System and Jekyll
        banner: /images/banner_GardenBay.png
      infobar:
        title: Use Isomer!
        subtitle: "It's easy and cheap!"
        link: Contact Us
        url: /contact-us/

    instead of:

    - hero:
        title: Isomer Pages Template
        subtitle: This website was built using the Isomer Design System and Jekyll
        banner: /images/banner_GardenBay.png
    - infobar:
        title: Use Isomer!
        subtitle: "It's easy and cheap!"
        link: Contact Us
